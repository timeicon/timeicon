## Welcome to the support page of Time Icon

Time Icon is a time-managed app developed with minimalist design principles.Whenever and wherever you just need to take out your phone, click on the button three or four times to record what you have just done.

### How to use

I tried a lot of time-managed apps, either too complicated or unreasonable. I just want to spend a few minutes a day, recording what I did in the day and how much time I spent. In the end I decided to do it myself. The core of time management is the ability to record quickly and accurately. The difference between this app and other similar apps is that it is more efficient. Simplify the category of things into icons, remove unnecessary complex functions, focus on the time spent recording, and don't care about start and end time. The result is that you can record the time spent on one thing with just a few clicks.   

For example, I just spent 1 hour and 30 minutes reading a book. Then you can click on:  (1) reading icon (2) 1h button (3) 30m button 
(4) Save button, it is recorded. If you want to record the title of the book and the number of pages read, just edit the Title and Detail of the record in your free time.
